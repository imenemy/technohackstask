Step 1:First we will import string and random:

import string
import random

explaination:
string – For accessing string constants. The ones we would need are –
  
string.ascii_letters:  ASCII is a system that is used to represent characters digitally, every ASCII character has its own unique code. string.ascii_letters is a string constant which contains all the letters in ASCII ranging from A to Z and a to z. Its value is non-locale dependent and it is just a concatenation of ascii_uppercase and ascii_lowercase. Thus it provides us the whole letter set as a string that can be used as desired.

string.digits:This is a pre-initialized string that contains all the digits in the Arabic numeral system i.e. 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9.

It should be kept in mind that even though these are digits, the type is still a string constant, and all digits are concatenated like this – “0123456789”. If we want to access specific numbers then we can do so using slicing.

string.punctuation: Apart from letters and digits, python also provides us all the special characters in a pre-initialized string constant. These include various kinds of braces, logical operators, comparison operators, arithmetical operators as well as punctuation marks like commas, inverted commas, periods, exclamations marks, and question marks. The whole string is – !”#$%&'()*+, -./:;<=>?@[\]^_`{|}~


random – The python random module helps a user to generate pseudo-random numbers. Inside the module, there are various functions that just depend on the function “random()”. This function generates a random float uniformly in the semi-open range [0.0, 1.0) i.e. it generates a decimal number greater than or equal to 0 and strictly less than one. Other functions use this number in their own ways. These functions can be used for bytes, integers, and sequences. for our task, we are interested in sequences. There are functions random. choices that take in a sequence as its argument and return a random element from that sequence.


Step 2:

Taking Input from user 

length = int(input("Enter password length: "))

this will take a Integer input from user in variable named length.

Step 3:
 
Including lowercase, uppercase, numeric digits, special symbols
 
characterList = string.ascii_lowercase + string.ascii_uppercase + string.digits + string.punctuation

Step 4:

Create a password variable with empty list.

password = []

Step 5:
Here we will start a loop for appending random element in password list and choosing random from characterList.

for i in range(length):
   
    # Picking a random character from our 
    # character list
    randomchar = random.choice(characterList)
     
    # appending a random character to password
    password.append(randomchar) 

Step 6:

Printing Password with all list element with join function.

print("The random password is " + "".join(password))
